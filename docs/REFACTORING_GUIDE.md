# Ted API Refactored Structure

This document explains the refactored structure of the Ted API codebase, which has been organized into clean, modular components.

## 📁 File Structure

### Core Application
- **`main.py`** - Clean entry point with app setup, middleware, and route registration
- **`src/models.py`** - Pydantic models for API requests/responses

### Business Logic
- **`src/chat.py`** - Chat service with Ted instance management and streaming logic
- **`src/transcription.py`** - Audio transcription service with OpenAI integration and hallucination detection

### API Routes
- **`src/api/__init__.py`** - API package initialization
- **`src/api/chat_routes.py`** - Chat-related endpoints (`/chat`, `/chat/stream`, `/chatlog`)
- **`src/api/transcription_routes.py`** - Audio transcription endpoint (`/transcribe_audio`)

### Existing Modules (unchanged)
- **`src/boot.py`** - Service initialization
- **`src/config.py`** - Configuration management
- **`src/ted.py`** - Ted agent implementation
- **`src/memory.py`** - Memory management
- **`src/llm.py`** - LLM client wrapper
- **`src/utils.py`** - Utility functions

## 🔄 What Changed

### Before Refactoring
- Single monolithic `main.py` file (506 lines)
- Mixed concerns: API endpoints, business logic, models, validation
- Difficult to maintain and test

### After Refactoring
- Clean separation of concerns
- Modular, testable components
- `main.py` reduced to ~60 lines of setup code
- Easy to extend with new features

## 📍 API Endpoints

All original endpoints are preserved:

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `/health` | GET | Health check |
| `/chat` | POST | Simple chat endpoint |
| `/chat/stream` | POST | Streaming chat with SSE |
| `/chatlog` | GET | Get chat history |
| `/transcribe_audio` | POST | Audio transcription |

## 🎯 Key Improvements

### 1. **Modular Architecture**
- Each module has a single responsibility
- Easy to test individual components
- Clean import structure

### 2. **Enhanced Transcription**
- Comprehensive hallucination detection
- Optimized prompts based on research
- Automatic fallback from GPT-4o to Whisper-1
- Duration-based validation

### 3. **Clean API Structure**
- Router-based organization
- Type-safe Pydantic models
- Consistent error handling

### 4. **Maintainability**
- Clear docstrings throughout
- Logical code organization
- Easy to add new features

## 🚀 Running the Application

The application runs exactly the same as before:

```bash
# Development
python main.py

# Production
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

## 🧪 Testing

Individual modules can now be tested in isolation:

```python
# Test transcription logic
from src.transcription import is_transcription_valid
assert is_transcription_valid("Hello world", "prompt", 2.0) == True

# Test chat service
from src.chat import get_ted_for_user
ted = get_ted_for_user("test_user")
```

## 📦 Dependencies

No new dependencies were added. The refactoring only reorganizes existing functionality.

## 🔧 Future Enhancements

The modular structure makes it easy to:
- Add new API endpoints
- Implement additional transcription providers
- Add middleware for authentication/rate limiting
- Create comprehensive test suites
- Add monitoring and metrics

## 💡 Benefits

1. **Maintainability**: Easy to understand and modify individual components
2. **Testability**: Each module can be tested independently
3. **Scalability**: Easy to add new features without touching existing code
4. **Team Development**: Multiple developers can work on different modules
5. **Code Reuse**: Business logic is now reusable across different contexts
